# CM3130 - Full Time: Interdisciplinary Team Project


### Running the Website on a local machine

To run on a local machine,
1. Have node js is installed (We used v18.18.2), this can be found here, [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Check that the EMS module is also installed, using the command `npm install ems`
3. Then us the command `npx serve .` and click on the link generated to see the page. 

As a note not all the pages are set up this way, using this was done mainly for testing the 3D viewer.

The 3js library used by the project can be found here where instructions for the use of the library can be also found, [3JS](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Installation), we used a CDN as our method of accessing the library.
